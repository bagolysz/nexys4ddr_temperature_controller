This project contains a complete implementation of a temperature controller system using a Nexys 4 DDR FPGA developer board and a C# Windows Forms desktop application.
The communication between the temperature sensor and the developer board is realized using I2C protocol. Then, the received information is
transmitted to a PC via UART communication protocol.
